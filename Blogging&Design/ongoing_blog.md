## Engineering Requirements
There are numerous software companies that help non-software businesses optimize their operations. These companies provide a range of services, from custom software development to data analytics and machine learning. However, often times there is a lot of competition in the market, and the process of finding the right software company can be challenging, especially for non-technical business owners. Thus, it is important for software companies to reach out to as many potential clients as possible, and to do so in a way that is both efficient and effective.

A solution to increase the software company's outreach is to develop a tool that can generate personalized cold emails for job applications. This tool would leverage AI and fine-tuning techniques to automate and optimize the creation of cold emails, saving time and increasing the chances of a successful outcome. By providing a seamless user experience and a powerful backend, the tool would revolutionize the process of reaching out to potential clients, making it easier for software companies to connect with non-software businesses.

This software, however, is intended for a specific audience: students and professionals who are looking to apply for jobs in the software industry. The tool would be designed to help them create personalized cold emails that are tailored to the specific requirements of the job they are applying for. By providing a range of templates and customization options, the tool would enable users to create compelling and effective cold emails that stand out from the competition. By using the same concepts and techniques that software companies use to optimize their operations, the tool would help job applicants increase their chances of landing their dream job.
